***NOTE***
3rd strategy explanation: The third strategy is implemented in a way that the AI
can choose from two sets of moves. The first (primary) set contains squares on
the board that are favorable according to the rules of the game and thus give the
player an advantage if occupied. If the AI is unable to occupy any of these squares
then it chooses from the second (secondary) set of squares that contain all other
squares where the AI player can move under the rules of the game.
