RULES OF OTHELLO: 
O always goes first. Players alternate placing X and O markers on the board on
either a 4x4 or 8x8 board. There are always four markers always placed on the
board at the start of each game. Both players can place their markers horizontally,
vetically or diagonally. A Player has to always make a move such that the player
traps any no of  opponent's maker between two of the player's markers. When this
happens the player can flip all of the opponent's marker that the player trapped
and the opponent's marker shall become the player's marker.In some cases when the
player makes a move, the player will see that they can flip two different rows or
more. Once the board becomes full, the winner is decided by which player has the
majority of their markers placed on the board. It is a draw if both players have
the same no of markers on the board. If a player cannot place any where on the board 
so as the make a flip,the player must pass their turn to the opponent. If the opponent 
also can't make a turn after theplayer passed the game ends and the winner is decided 
by the player with majority no of markers onthe board, with blank spaces on the board 
counting towards the winner's score.
HOW THE GAME LOOP WORKS:
The game loop will print the board, check if there is a winner. It will ask the
Human player to make a move, it will then check if the move is valid, if it isn't it
will reprompt the Human player. Otherwise it will continue on.print the board, check
if there is a winner. If there is a winner,then the game will end,otherwise the AI
will make a move. The game loop will continue to run until there is a winner or there
is a draw.
