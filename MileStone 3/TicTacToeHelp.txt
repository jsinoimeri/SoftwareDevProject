RULES OF TIC-TAC-TOE:
X always goes first. Players  alternate placing Xs and Os on the board until
either (a) one player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically or diagonally
or (b) all squares are filled. If a player is able to draw three Xs or three Os
in a row, that player wins. If all the squares are filled and neither player has
won, the game is considered a draw.
HOW THE GAME LOOP WORKS
The game loop will print the board, check if there is a winner. It will ask the
Human player to make a move, it will then check if the move is valid, if it isn't
it will reprompt the Human player. Otherwise it will continue on, print the board,
check if there is a winner. If there is a winner, then the game will end, otherwise
the AI will make a move.
The game loop will continue to run until there is a winner or there's a draw.
